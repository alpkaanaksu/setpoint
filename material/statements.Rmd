| A          | A notable finding was that the initial reaction and the rate of adaptation varied considerably between different life events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Luhmann et al.

| A1         | For instance, the initial reaction to marriage was positive, but subsequent adaptation was fast and completed after 2 years on average (Lucas et al., 2003).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                      |                                    | positive valence: fast adaptation                                              |     |
| A2         | In contrast, the rate of adaptation was much slower for negative events such as the onset of disability (Lucas, 2007b), widowhood (Lucas et al., 2003; Specht, Egloff, & Schmukle, 2011), and divorce (Lucas, 2005).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                      |                                    | negative valence: slow adaptation                                              |     |
| A3         | The findings were perhaps most striking for unemployment: After the beginning of unemployment, mean levels of SWB were significantly below baseline, even if people became reemployed (Lucas et al., 2004). Repeated unemployment spells aggravate this effect (Luhmann & Eid, 2009).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                      |                                    |                                                                                |     |
| B          | Together, these studies indicate that major life events can have strong effects on SWB and that the strength of these effects varies, depending on the life events considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                      |                                    |                                                                                |     |

| F1         | From the stress perspective, life events are viewed as specific types of stressors (e.g., Park, 2010; Segerstrom & Miller, 2004). Stressful life events are all events that significantly disturb the daily routine (Turner & Wheaton, 1997). This definition explicitly includes desirable events such as marriage or vacation (Holmes & Rahe, 1967).                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                      | Life Event -c→ Stress              | The stress perspective is easier to model.                                     |     |
| F2         | By contrast, minor stressors such as daily hassles and uplifts (Kanner, Coyne, Schaefer, & Lazarus, 1981) are distinct from stressful life events. From the developmental perspective, life events are viewed as specific transitions. Transitions are defined as a “discontinuity in a person’s life space of which he is aware and which requires new behavioural responses” (Hopson & Adams, 1976, p. 24).                                                                                          |                                                                      |                                    |                                                                                |     |
| F3         | For the purpose of this metaanalysis, we developed a narrower definition of life events that integrates elements from both perspectives. According to our working definition, life events are time-discrete transitions that mark the beginning or the end of a specific status. A status is a nominal variable with at least two levels.                                                                                                                                                              | Luhmann et al.

| G1         | The adaptation process is initiated by an external stimulus (e.g., a major life event) that causes a physiological or psychological response (e.g., decreased SWB). Over time, the responsiveness diminishes and the level of SWB returns to its preevent level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Luhmann et al.

| H          | Most major life events are—at least to some extent— controllable and predictable and can therefore be anticipated. This anticipation might cause a specific hedonic reaction even before the event occurred: If the spouse is terminally ill, the hedonic reaction to bereavement starts long before the spouse actually dies. These so-called anticipatory or lead effects can be observed months or even several years before the occurrence of the event (Clark, Diener, Georgellis, & Lucas, 2008) | Luhmann et al.
